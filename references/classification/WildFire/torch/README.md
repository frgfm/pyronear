# Train WildFire

We propose here a demonstration of how to use pyro-vision to train a model to detect wildfire outbreaks.

This script allows you to train a binary classification model on our WilfFire dataset. You can train here all models available on [Holocron](https://github.com/frgfm/Holocron/tree/master/holocron/models) repository

You can either follow the procedure below to train the model on your own machine or click on the following collab link to use our training notebook on remote servers for free.

## Install

Install pyro-vision first

```bash
pip install pyronear
```
