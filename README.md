The increasing adoption of mobile phones have significantly shortened the duration between the beginning of a wildfire and the firefighting agents being alerted. In less dense areas, limiting and minimizing this amount of time is critical to preserve forest areas.

PyroNear aims at offering an wildfire early detection system with state-of-the-art performances at minimal deployment costs.
